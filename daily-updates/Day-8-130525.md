### 7 stages of the Data Life Cycle

**1. Data Generation / Creation**

What happens: Data is generated from various sources — transactions, users, devices, systems, sensors, etc.

Example:
A customer places an order on an eCommerce site like Amazon. Data like customer ID, order ID, product ID, timestamp, and payment details are generated.

**2. Data Collection**

What happens: The raw data is collected and aggregated into a centralized system.

Example:
The order, payment, and shipping information is collected into the company’s database or cloud storage (e.g., MySQL database, AWS S3).

**3. Data Processing**

What happens: Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and organized to make it usable for analysis.

Example: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing date formats, or joining multiple tables like orders + customers + products using SQL or Python/Excel.

**4. Data Storage**

What happens: Processed data is stored securely for future use and access.

Example:
Cleaned customer order data is stored in a data warehouse like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, or even Power BI's model.

**5. Data Analysis**

What happens: Analysts examine the data to derive insights and answer business questions.

Example:
Using Power BI or Excel to visualize:

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?

- What is the average delivery time per state?

- Which sellers have the highest return rates?

**6. Data Visualization & Reporting**

What happens: Insights are communicated via dashboards, charts, and reports for decision-making.

Example:
A Power BI dashboard showing top-selling categories by region, delivery delays, and customer satisfaction scores is presented to management.

**7. Data Archiving / Destruction**

What happens: Old or unused data is archived for compliance or deleted if it’s no longer needed.

Example:
Orders older than 5 years are archived to reduce storage costs. Personal customer data is deleted after the legal retention period to comply with GDPR.
