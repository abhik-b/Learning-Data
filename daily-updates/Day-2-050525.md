## Is Reading Data a transformation or action?

Neither ! It's a setup step for loading the data into a data frame from a external source,after this data is loaded then the transformation action whatever you want to do.

## Schema Enforcement

Schema enforcement means that Spark strictly checks and enforces the data types and structure (the schema) we define when reading or processing data.

to define schema we do

```py
schema = StructType([
    StructField("name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
])

```

Inferred Schema means when schema is inferred by Spark by default. Enforced means we explicitly define the structure.

## What happens if you try to insert a null into a non-nullable field?

if your schema defines a field as nullable = False, and the incoming data contains a null value:

Spark will throw an error during reading or transformation.

This is part of schema enforcement to prevent bad data from entering the pipeline.
