ðŸŒ» **Learnt about Staging**

A staging table is a copy of data which is used as a safe workspace for cleaning transforming and analysing the data without touching the raw original source of data.

We do this to protect the raw data work on the staging table because what if something breaks during this cleaning, transforming or analysing in that situation we can always revert back to the original data.
